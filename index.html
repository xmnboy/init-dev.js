<!--
Recommended JavaScript library load order for hybrid Cordova apps:

    * "Device-Independent" JavaScript libraries (see README.md).
    * OPTIONAL: weinre debug script tag for remote console debug.
    * Cordova/PhoneGap device JavaScript library.
    * "Device-Dependent" JavaScript libraries (see README.md).
    * Application JavaScript <script> tags and libraries.
    * OPTIONAL: weinre debug script tag for remote console debug.

In complex projects, the JavaScript load order is important. You must insure that the underlying
device API native code finishes its init, which usually takes longer than the webview init...
